# Drone Detection | Simple Neural Network Architecture made with MLPClassifier by using Scikit-learn library in Python 
In order to decide whether an image is drone or not, I used multi-layer classifier (MLP) algorithm in scikit-learn library. The reason that I used neural networks is the fact that in computer vision, neural networks are tremendously useful compared to simple logistic regression.
